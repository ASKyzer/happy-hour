# happy-hour
This project is an attempt to create a DC-specific happy hour app.
Existing apps were found severely-lacking in their UI elements.
The project was conceived and organized by Adrian Kyzer.
The app was developed by a four-person team over one week.
The total time spent on the project, including time spent learning new tools, is estimated at ["a lot"].

We utilized HTML, CSS with Materialize, JavaScript with JQuery, and Firebase.
Significant time was devoted to design elements, as well as ensuring mobile-compatibility.
Internally, we // add info on inner workings with databases, arrays, etc. //

Look for our deployed and fully-usable app at: [werule.com]
We hope you enjoy our work.
# cheers
